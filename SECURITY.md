# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Generally speaking, only the latest version, available on the main [website](https://citations.joshuarocks.me), is supported. This site automatically updates, but if you wish to visit previous versions of the site, you can do so. Each release generally links a Cloudflare Pages link that links to that version of the site. This is not recommended. Below is a list of supported versions. This will almost always just be the latest version, but in case of major changes, I might provide support for an older version.
| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.1.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| 1.0.x   | :x:  |


## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in the site or its code, immediately report it. You can do this as an issue on [Github](https://github.com/Thatoddone1/citations/issues) or send an email to [hello@joshuarocks.me](mailto:hello@joshuarocks.me). Thank you.
